This is my good old Vim setup, that has evolved over the years. I don't usually clone this repo manually -- installation is handled by the dotfiles installer.


TO INSTALL:

Clone repo to ~/.vim (fork first if you'd like)

    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc

    vim +PlugInstall +q


FEATURES

* My great opinions
* Relatively simple file
* Mostly graceful degradation of features

Syntax support: Markdown, CoffeeScript, Jade, Nim

Integration: Git (fugitive.vim) Jekyll (jekyll.vim) Github gists (gist.vim)

Other plugins: FuzzyFinder NERDTree Taglist Align snipmate.vim ConqueShell

+ Much more


TIPS

Have a look at the key bindings in vimrc.
Mess around with plugins.vim.
