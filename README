This is my good old Vim setup. For a flashier but more engineered alternative, have google for spf13-vim or Vimified.


TO INSTALL:

Clone repo to ~/.vim (fork first if you'd like)

    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc

    vim +BundleInstall +q




FEATURES

* My great opinions
* Quite simple config file
* Mostly graceful degradation
* Plugins via Vundle

* Added syntax support
  - Markdown (and markdown-preview)
  - CoffeeScript
  - ANSI escaped files

* Integration
  - Git (fugitive.vim)
  - Jekyll blogging (jekyll.vim)
  - Github gists (gist.vim)

* Useful plugins
  - FuzzyFinder
  - NERDTree
  - Taglist
  - Align
  - Tab completion (snipmate.vim)
  - ConqueShell

And more.


SOFT REQUIREMENTS:

Exuberant ctags (for taglist)
$ sudo apt-get install ctags


TIPS

Have a look at the key bindings in vimrc.
Mess around with plugins.vim.
