This is my good old Vim setup, that has evolved over the years. I don't usually clone this repo manually -- it is handlet by some autoinstall script.

TO INSTALL:

Clone repo to ~/.vim (fork first if you'd like), then run `vim +PlugInstall +qa`.

FEATURES

* Plugins managed by VimPlug
* UI/workflow enhancements
* Understandable file structure
* Language support
+ Much more
